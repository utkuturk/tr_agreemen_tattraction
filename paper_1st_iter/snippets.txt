## Turkish relative clauses and plural marking

Before discussing the experiments, I will touch upon the mechanisms that I utilize in the experiments: optional plural agreement, relative clause structure, and syncretism between possessive and accusative. 

Turkish plural agreement is quite similar with regards to the subject-verb number agreement in the first and second plural person. However, Turkish plural agreement is optional in third person plurals as shown in \autoref{TB1} and \autoref{TB2}. The other important characteristicc of Turkish plural agreement is the fact that the nominal and verbal plural marking is done by the same morpheme *-lAr*\footnote{The convention of using an uppercase A is to show that the morpheme can surface as either \textit{-ler} or \textit{-lar} according to the previous vowel due to the vowel harmony reasons.}. 


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{TB1} Dün çocuk-\textsc{Lar} okul-a git-ti-\textsc{Ler} mi?
\ex 
\gll Dün çocuk-LAR okul-a git-ti mi?\\
yesterday child-\textsc{Pl} school-\textsc{Dat} go-\textsc{Pst}(-\textsc{Pl}) Q\\
\trans ``Did the children go to school yesterday?''
\label{TB2}
\end{exe}

As for Turkish relative clauses, they always precede the external head noun [@Goksel2004; @Taylan2015] and they use either *-An* or *-dIk* nomilizers to show the referentiality of the subject within the relative clause as shown in \autoref{TB3} and \autoref{TB4} [@Haig1997]. Moreover, due to pro-drop and null object properties of the Turkish [see @Ozturk2005], relative clauses can consist of only the verb itself in Turkish as in \autoref{TB5}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{TB3}
\gll Kazı-lar-ın yap-ıl-dığ-ı alan ... \\
excavation-\textsc{Pl}-\textsc{Gen} do-\textsc{Pass}-\textsc{Nmlz}-\textsc{Poss} area ... \\
\glt ``The place where the excavations are done ...''
\ex \label{TB4}
\gll Kazı-lar yap-ıl-an alan ... \\
excavation-\textsc{Pl} do-\textsc{Pass}-\textsc{Nmlz} area ... \\
\glt ``A place where some excavations are done ...''
\ex \label{TB5}
\gll Gör-düğ-ü kuş çok güzel-di.\\
see-\textsc{Nmlz}-\textsc{Poss} bird very pretty-\textsc{Pst}\\
\glt ``The bird that he/she saw was very pretty.''
\end{exe}

Final characteristics that interest us in this paper is the morphological syncretism between the accusative case and possessive suffix in Turkish. When the possessive case is attached to a nominal stem that ends with a consonant, it is pronounced as \textit{-I}, which is exactly how the accusative case is also pronounced in the same environment in Turkish. However, the ambiguity is immediately resolved when they follow a nominal stem that ends with a vowel. In the latter environment, the accusative case surfaces as *-yI* whereas the possessive surfaces as *-sI(n)*\footnote{The final \textit{n} only surfaces when any other morphemes follow the possessive suffix. Otherwise, it surfaces as \textit{-sI}} as shown in \autoref{TB6}-\autoref{TB9}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{TB6}
\gll Kuş-\textbf{u} beğen-di-m.\\
bird-\textsc{Acc} like-\textsc{Pst}-\textsc{1Sg}\\
\glt ``I liked the bird.''
\ex \label{TB7}
\gll Emin'in kuş-\textbf{u} güzel-miş.\\
Emin-\textsc{Gen} bird-\textsc{Poss} pretty-\textsc{Evd}\\
\glt ``Emin's bird was pretty.''
\ex \label{TB8}
\gll Kedi-\textbf{yi} beğen-di-m.\\
cat-\textsc{Acc} like-\textsc{Pst}-\textsc{1Sg}\\
\glt ``I liked the cat.''
\ex \label{TB9}
\gll Emin'in kedi-\textbf{si} güzel-miş.\\
Emin-\textsc{Gen} cat-\textsc{Poss} pretty-\textsc{Evd}\\
\glt ``Emin's cat was pretty.''
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Thus, @LagoEtAl:2018's finding could potentially be explained with occasional shallow processing. When all syntactic relations in the sentence were processed fully, the possessive noun may have been identified as the controller. Meanwhile, the genitive noun may sometimes have been erroneously identified as the controller during shallow processing because genitives are more likely to act as agreement controllers than accusatives.
